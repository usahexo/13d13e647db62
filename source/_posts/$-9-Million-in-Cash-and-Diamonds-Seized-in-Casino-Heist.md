#  $ 9 Million in Cash and Diamonds Seized in Casino Heist

Authorities in the Philippines report that a total of $9 million in cash and diamonds was seized following a casino heist. The suspect, who has not yet been identified, was able to make off with the haul after sneaking into the casino's security room.

The incident took place on Sunday evening at the Solaire Resort and Casino in Pasay City. Officials say that the suspect was able to get into the security room through a window and stole 10 safe boxes containing the cash and diamonds.

The suspect is still at large and authorities are currently investigating the incident. In a statement, casino officials said that they were working with authorities to identify and apprehend the suspect.

This is not the first time that a casino has been targeted in the Philippines. In June 2017, a gunman opened fire at Resorts World Manila, killing 38 people.

#   $ 6 Million in Diamonds Still Missing After Casino Heist 

$ 6 million worth of diamonds are still missing after a daring casino heist in Monaco. The theft took place on July 18th, when thieves managed to break into the Hotel de Paris and make off with the jewels.

This is not the first time that the hotel has been targeted by thieves. In July 2008, a group of burglars made off with an estimated $128 million worth of diamonds and other jewels.

It is not yet clear how the latest theft was carried out, but officials believe that it was an inside job. The hotel has been put under increased security since the robbery took place, but so far no arrests have been made.

The diamonds have a total value of $6 million, but they are said to be of low quality and unlikely to fetch a high price on the black market. Nonetheless, their disappearance has caused quite a stir in Monaco, one of the most exclusive resorts in the world.

#  Heist of the Century: $ 12 Million Stolen from Casino

In what has been dubbed the “heist of the century,” over $12 million was stolen from a casino in Monaco early Monday morning.

The theft took place at the prestigious Casino de Monte Carlo, one of the most well-known and luxurious casinos in the world.

According to police, a group of masked men entered the casino through a side entrance shortly before 3:00am and made their way to the cashier’s office. There they stole a large sum of money that was being stored in a safe.

Despite a large police presence in the area, the men were able to escape without detection. It is believed that they used a waiting car to make their getaway.

This is not the first time that the Casino de Monte Carlo has been targeted by thieves. In 2010, around $2 million was stolen from the casino in a similar robbery.

In light of this latest incident, casino officials are vowing to increase security measures at the premises.

#  $ 3 Million in Jewels Recovered After Casino Heist 

Three million dollars worth of jewels were recovered yesterday after a casino heist in the heart of the Las Vegas strip. The jewels, which had been on loan from Harry Winston, were found in a duffel bag at the airport.

The gems had been on display at the Cosmopolitan casino as part of an advertising campaign for the new Harry Winston jewelry collection. The heist occurred sometime between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Tuesday night, when thieves made off with the bag of jewels.

The Cosmopolitan released a statement yesterday saying that they were "grateful to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department for their swift action in recovering the stolen jewels." They also said that they were working with Harry Winston to determine the value of the gems.

It is currently unclear how the thieves managed to steal the jewels without being detected by security cameras or staff members. An investigation is currently underway.

#  Casino Owner Taunts Police After Major Heist: 'You'll Never Catch Me!'

 Casino owner Bashar al-Assad taunted police after a major heist, declaring 'you'll never catch me!' The brazen robbery occurred at the Tabaris casino in central Damascus, with Assad and his cronies making off with millions in cash and jewels.

The casino owner's taunt is in stark contrast to the predictions of many police officers, who maintain that they will eventually catch up with the culprits. One senior officer remarked that 'we have plenty of leads, and we are confident that we will bring these criminals to justice.'

The brazen heist has reignited public anger towards Assad and his criminal regime, which has been involved in a series of high-profile robberies and money laundering schemes. In addition to the casino theft, Assad's inner circle has also been linked to oil smuggling, pharmaceuticals fraud, and other crimes.

The Tabaris casino robbery is just the latest in a long line of scandals for Bashar al-Assad. For more than four years now, the Syrian president has been engaged in a brutal civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. Assad's regime stands accused of using chemical weapons against civilians, torturing prisoners, and carrying out other atrocities.

Despite this record of brutality and criminality, Assad continues to enjoy the support of Russia and Iran. While the United States and its allies have called for his removal from power, they have failed to take any concrete action to remove him from power. This has allowed Assad to remain in power while his country burns.
