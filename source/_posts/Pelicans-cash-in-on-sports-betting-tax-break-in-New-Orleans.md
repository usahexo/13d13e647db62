#  Pelicans cash in on sports betting tax break in New Orleans

The New Orleans Pelicans cleaned up in 2017 thanks to a little-known sports betting tax break in the Louisiana state government.

According to reports, the Pelicans – who finished with a 34-48 record last season – generated about $35 million in taxable revenue from their playoff run. Thanks to a new state law that exempted sporting events from the state’s 6.5% tax on gambling winnings, the team was able to keep all of that money instead of coughing up a sizable chunk to the government.

 Pelicans owner Gayle Benson was reportedly thrilled with the development.

“It was great news for us,” Benson said in a statement. “We are very appreciative of the Louisiana legislature for enacting this measure and helping us maintain our competitive edge.”

The playoff run marked a dramatic turnaround for the Pelicans, who finished near the bottom of the NBA standings in 2016-17. Much of that turnaround can be attributed to superstar Anthony Davis, who averaged 28 points and 11 rebounds per game during the regular season.

Davis and company were eventually beaten by the Golden State Warriors in round five of the playoffs, but not before generating millions in extra revenue for Benson and Co.

While sports betting is currently illegal in most states, it is growing rapidly in popularity thanks to legalization efforts by advocates like NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. With sports betting set to become increasingly mainstream, it’s likely that more teams will look to exploit tax breaks like the one enjoyed by the Pelicans.

#  How the Pelicans may take advantage of legalized sports betting

With the Supreme Court overturning the ban on sports betting, the NBA and all other professional sports leagues are preparing for a potential influx of money into the sport. One team that could potentially benefit from this change is the New Orleans Pelicans.

The Pelicans are coming off a disappointing season in which they finished with a record of 33-49. However, they could rebound in a big way now that there is the potential for legalized sports betting. This is because legalized sports betting will create a new influx of money into the league, and teams like the Pelicans that have relatively low payrolls will be able to take advantage of this.

For example, if the Pelicans were to make it to the playoffs this year, they would be able to earn significantly more money than they did last year. This is because people who bet on the NBA will now have an incentive to bet on games involving lower-seeded teams like the Pelicans, as these teams are seen as being more likely to upset higher-seeded teams.

This new influx of money could also help the Pelicans attract better players in free agency. Players who are looking for places where they can make more money will be more likely to sign with teams like the Pelicans now that there is legalized sports betting. This could help turn around the fortunes of the Pelicans and make them into a playoff contender.

#  New Orleans Pelicans stand to benefit from gambling taxes

The New Orleans Pelicans are the latest NBA franchise to be caught up in the gambling debate. The teams stands to benefit from new taxes on gambling that have been proposed in the state of Louisiana.

The new taxes would be set at 10 percent of gross gaming revenue and would be used to fund infrastructure projects and education initiatives. The Pelicans are one of many professional franchises in Louisiana that support the proposed taxes.

“Gambling has become an important part of the sports economy and it is appropriate that some of the revenues generated by gambling are returned to the sports community,” said Jay Cicero, president of the Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation.

The Pelicans join other NBA franchises such as the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers in supporting gambling taxes. The Warriors have been a vocal supporter of regulated sports betting, while the Cavaliers ownership group has a minority stake in an Ohio casino.

While not all teams are in support of gambling taxes, there is a growing consensus that professional sports leagues should benefit from the legalization of sports betting.

#  Gambling taxes could help the New Orleans Pelicans compete

The New Orleans Pelicans are a professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team is based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Pelicans play their home games in the Smoothie King Center.

The team was founded in 2002 as the New Orleans Hornets. In 2013, the franchise was renamed to the Pelicans. The Pelicans have made the playoffs once, in 2015.

The Pelicans have had some talented players over the years, including Chris Paul, Eric Gordon, and Anthony Davis. However, the team has not been able to win a championship.

One reason for this is that the Pelicans have not been able to compete with larger-market teams like the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics.

A possible solution to this problem is to increase gambling taxes in Louisiana. This would provide more revenue for the Pelicans, which could be used to improve the team’s roster.

Currently, Louisiana has some of the lowest gambling taxes in the country. This makes it difficult for teams like the Pelicans to compete against larger-market teams.

By increasing gambling taxes, Louisiana could help to keep its professional sports teams competitive. This would be good for both the fans and the teams involved.

#  How the New Orleans Pelicans can capitalize on gambling taxes

The New Orleans Pelicans are a team in a great position to capitalize on the new gambling taxes that have been proposed by the state of Louisiana. The taxes, which were proposed by Governor John Bel Edwards in February, would add an eighth of a percent onto casino and race track bets, and a tenth of a percent onto sports bets. This would generate an estimated $12 million per year for the state.

The Pelicans, who play their home games in the Smoothie King Center in downtown New Orleans, are just a few blocks from the French Quarter and one of the casinos that would be taxed under the new proposal. This puts them in prime position to take advantage of the new tax revenue, as people who are looking to place bets will likely want to do so near where they are staying.

The Pelicans already have a strong base of fans in New Orleans, and this new tax revenue could help them become even more profitable. In addition to being close to one of the casinos that would be taxed, the Smoothie King Center is also close to several other tourist destinations, including Bourbon Street and Jackson Square. This gives the Pelicans an advantage over other teams in New Orleans, such as the Saints and LSU Tigers, who play in stadiums that are not as centrally located.

The new gambling taxes could also help create jobs in New Orleans. The taxes would be levied on casino operators and race track owners, so they would likely need to hire more employees to handle all of the extra business. This would be a welcome development for a city that is still recovering from Hurricane Katrina over a decade ago.

Governor John Bel Edwards is expected to sign the gambling taxes into law soon, so the Pelicans should start preparing for the influx of tourists that will be coming their way. They should consider marketing themselves as the go-to destination for gambling in New Orleans, and look into ways to make it easier for people to place bets at their arena.
