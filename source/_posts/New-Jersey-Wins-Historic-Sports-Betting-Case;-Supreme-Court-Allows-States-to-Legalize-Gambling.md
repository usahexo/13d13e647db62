#  New Jersey Wins Historic Sports Betting Case; Supreme Court Allows States to Legalize Gambling

On Monday, May 14th, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey in a landmark 6-3 decision that overturned a 26-year-old federal ban on sports betting. This ruling paves the way for states to legalize gambling within their borders, and could result in an estimated $150 billion windfall for the US gaming industry.

The case, Christie v. NCAA, centered around a 2012 law passed by New Jersey that attempted to legalize sports betting in the state. The NCAA and four major professional sports leagues – the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL – sued to block the law, arguing that it violated the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA), a federal prohibition on sports betting.

In Monday’s decision, Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority that PASPA “violates the anti-commandeering principle embedded in the Tenth Amendment”. The anti-commandeering principle is a legal doctrine that prohibits the federal government from compelling states to carry out its policies.

The Court’s ruling is a victory for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has championed legalized sports betting as a way to bolster his state’s struggling casinos and racetracks. It’s also a major win for gambling advocates nationwide, who have long argued that legalizing sports betting would bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped states.

Opponents of legalized gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and organized crime, but supporters say those risks can be managed with strong regulation. “Today’s decision is a victory for the rights of states and their people to make their own decisions about social policy”, said Governor Christie in a statement following the ruling.

So what does this decision mean for American gamblers? First and foremost, it opens up the possibility of legal sports betting in all 50 states. Previously, only Nevada was allowed to offer full-scale sports betting thanks to an exemption in PASPA. Now other states will be able to follow suit, provided they pass any applicable legislation regulating gambling within their borders.

It’s too early to tell exactly how this will play out across the country, but we can expect a flurry of legislative activity as states scramble to get into the sports betting game. Casino operators and other stakeholders are likely salivating at the prospect of such massive new market opportunity, and there will likely be heated competition among states over who can offer the most attractive wagering options.

For now, New Jersey is leading the charge with plans to start taking bets later this week at Monmouth Park Racetrack and Ocean Resort Casino. Other states are expected to follow suit in short order – Pennsylvania has already introduced legislation authorizing sports betting within its borders – so keep your eyes peeled for updates on your state’s proposed regulations.

#   Delaware Sports Betting Revenue Soars as New Jersey Battles for its Share

 Delaware’s sports betting revenue continues to soar as New Jersey battles for a share of the market. In October, the state generated $7.5 million in sports betting revenue, up from $5.5 million in September and just $2.8 million in August.

Delaware was one of the first states to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down the federal ban in May. Since then, New Jersey has been battling to get a piece of the action, with Delaware arguing that its law predates New Jersey’s.

But a federal court recently ruled that New Jersey can move ahead with its plans to allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks. The ruling could pave the way for other states to legalize sports betting, and it remains to be seen how Delaware will respond.

The rise in Delaware’s sports betting revenue is good news for the state’s casinos and racetracks, which are seeing a surge in business thanks to legalized gambling. In October, Dover Downs Casino generated $3 million in revenue from sports betting, while Harrington Raceway & Casino brought in $1 million.

The boost in gambling brings mixed blessings for Delaware, however. The state faces a budget shortfall of more than $400 million this year, and officials are looking to gambling revenues to help fill the gap. But there is also concern that legalization of sports betting could lead to increased addiction and social problems.

So far, there seems to be little evidence of major problems emerging from legalized sports betting. But as more states jump into the fray, it remains to be seen how things will play out. In any case, Delaware is benefiting from its early entry into the market and looks set to continue raking in millions in sports betting revenue

#  Pennsylvania Enacts Sports Betting Legislation in Response to NJ Victory

On October 26, 2017, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law a bill that legalized sports betting in the state. The move came in response to a recent ruling by the US Supreme Court that struck down a federal ban on sports betting. The new law allows casinos in Pennsylvania to offer sports betting, including wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events.

Supporters of the measure argued that it would be a boon for the state's casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years. Critics of the legislation, meanwhile, voiced concerns about the potential for addiction and corruption.

Pennsylvania is not the only state to legalize sports betting in response to the Supreme Court ruling. Earlier this month, New Jersey became the first state to offer legal sports betting since 1992. Several other states, including West Virginia and Rhode Island, are also considering similar measures.

#  West Virginia to Follow Suit, legalizes sports betting in anticipation of increased revenue

West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday that the state will legalize sports betting in anticipation of increased revenue. This marks another step in the legalization of sports betting, following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn a federal law that banned such betting.

"It is critical that we act swiftly to get this new industry up and running in order to provide much-needed new revenues to our state," Governor Justice said in a news release.

The state plans to finalize regulations and have sports betting available by the start of the NFL season in September. The West Virginia Lottery Commission will be responsible for regulating the industry.

According to a study commissioned by the casino industry, legalizing sports betting could generate $116 million in annual revenue for West Virginia. This would include $27 million from taxes on gambling operators and $89 million from bets placed by residents of the state.

Governor Justice has estimated that West Virginia can bring in at least $20 million annually through sports betting alone. The addition of online wagering could increase this number significantly.

The move comes as other states are also moving to legalize sports betting. On Wednesday, Delaware became the first state outside of Nevada to offer bets on individual games. The state is offering a full slate of professional and college games, with both mobile and retail options available.

#  California and Illinois Continue to Resist Legalization, Could Lose Out on Millions in Revenue

With nine states and the District of Columbia having legalized cannabis for recreational use, it would seem that the nationwide momentum is on the side of legalization. However, there are two significant holdouts in the form of California and Illinois.

The legalization of cannabis has been linked to a number of benefits, including reduced crime rates, increased tax revenue, and decreased opioid use. Legalization also presents opportunities in terms of new businesses and job growth.

Despite these benefits, California and Illinois have yet to legalize cannabis for recreational use. This could end up costing both states millions in revenue.

California is home to the largest legal cannabis market in the world. The state's cannabis industry is worth an estimated $2.7 billion, but it could be worth much more if it were legalized for recreational use. If California were to legalize cannabis, it could expect to see an increase in tax revenue of $1 billion per year, according to a study by the University of California-Berkeley.

Illinois is also missing out on potential tax revenue from legalized cannabis. The state's current cannabis market is worth an estimated $350 million, but it could be worth much more if it were legalized. If Illinois were to legalize cannabis, it could expect to see an increase in tax revenue of $500 million per year, according to a study by the Southern Illinois University Carbondale.

Both California and Illinois have voiced concerns about public safety and health effects related to marijuana legalization. However, these concerns can be addressed through regulation and education campaigns. It is time for both states to legalize cannabis and take advantage of its many benefits.
