#  San Manuel Casino expanding with new poker room

Casino officials in San Bernardino announced Tuesday that they were expanding the casino floor to include a new poker room.

The expansion, slated for completion in May, will add an additional 12 tables to the casino’s current offering, and bring the total number of poker rooms on site to three.

The move is seen as an effort by the casino to capitalize on the growing popularity of poker in California. The state currently has over 200 licensed card rooms, and more than $2 billion worth of cash was wagered on poker in 2016.

“San Manuel is excited to offer our guests more opportunities to experience poker in a luxurious setting,” said casino spokesperson Doug Kessler in a statement.

In addition to the new poker room, the casino will also be unveiling a new high limit gaming area later this year.
