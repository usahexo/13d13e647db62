#  Grizzlies Look to Continue Momentum in Bitcoin Casino Sports Betting

The Memphis Grizzlies have been on a tear lately, and they will be looking to continue that momentum when they take on the Phoenix Suns in Bitcoin casino sports betting action on Wednesday night. The Grizzlies come into this contest with a 27-22 record, good for fifth place in the Western Conference.

Phoenix is 18-32 on the year and in 13th place in the West. The Suns are coming off a 111-101 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Monday night.
Suns forward TJ Warren led all scorers with 34 points in that contest, while Devin Booker added 31 points.

Grizzlies guard Mike Conley led Memphis with 31 points in their 121-114 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night. Marc Gasol chipped in with 19 points and 10 rebounds for Memphis in that victory.

This game is scheduled to tip off at 10:00 PM ET at the FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee.

The Suns have had a tough year, but they have some talented young players who could cause problems for Memphis. Booker is one of the most promising young players in the NBA, and Warren is also a dangerous scorer.

The Grizzlies are one of the best defensive teams in the league, however, and they should be able to limit Phoenix’s offensive output. Conley and Gasol are two of the best players at their respective positions, and they will both need to play well if Memphis wants to come away with a victory.

#  Grizzlies Ready to Shine in Bitcoin Casino Sports Betting Arena

The Memphis Grizzlies have been one of the more consistent teams in the NBA over the past few seasons. Led by Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph, they are primed to make a deep playoff run this year.

What you may not know is that the Grizzlies are also one of the early adopters of Bitcoin casino sports betting. In fact, their owner, Robert Pera, is a big proponent of Bitcoin and has even invested in a few Bitcoin startups.

This makes for an interesting combination. The Grizzlies are a great team with a strong bitcoin foundation. This could lead to some big wins in the bitcoin casino sports betting arena.

Let's take a closer look at how the Grizzlies are doing in the NBA and how they could fare in bitcoin casino sports betting.

The Memphis Grizzlies had a productive offseason, acquiring Vince Carter and signing Mike Miller. They also re-signed Tony Allen and Ed Davis. This gives them one of the deepest benches in the NBA.

Their starting lineup is solid as well. Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph will continue to be mainstays in the frontcourt. Mike Conley and Jerryd Bayless will run things at point guard and shooting guard, respectively. And finally, Tony Allen will provide defense off the bench.

The key to the Grizzlies' success this year will be their bench players stepping up when called upon. Guys like Quincy Pondexter, Jon Leuer, Tayshaun Prince, and Nick Calathes need to provide quality minutes if Memphis wants to make a deep playoff run.

So far this season, things are looking good for the Grizzlies. They are currently in 5th place in the Western Conference with a record of 23-19. If they can maintain this pace, they should make it into the playoffs for the 4th consecutive year.

As for bitcoin casino sports betting, things are looking just as good for Memphis fans. The Grizzlies have odds of +650 to win this year's NBA championship at Betcoin Sportsbook . This puts them behind only teams like Miami Heat (+500), San Antonio Spurs (+600), Oklahoma City Thunder (+650), and Los Angeles Clippers (+800).
