#  What is Hi-Lo Switch?

The Hi-Lo switch is a type of electrical switch that uses a binary logic to turn on or off an electrical current. The switch is named for its two possible states, high and low. In its high state, the switch allows an electric current to flow through it, while in its low state the electric current is blocked.

# How does Hi-Lo Switch work?

Hi-Lo switches are used in many different applications, but they all work on the same principle. The switch consists of two metal contacts, one that is normally open and one that is normally closed. When the switch is in its low state, the contact that is normally closed is connected to the ground while the contact that is normally open is disconnected from the ground. When the switch is in its high state, the contact that is normally closed is disconnected from the ground while the contact that is normally open is connected to the ground.

#  What is the Hi-Lo Switch game?

The Hi-Lo Switch game is a popular casino game that is played using a deck of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to make as many winning hands as possible by correctly guessing whether the next card will be higher or lower than the current card. 

The game begins by placing a bet and then selecting either the "HI" or "LO" button. The dealer will then deal one card face up and one card face down. Players must then guess whether the next card will be higher or lower than the current card. If the player guesses correctly, they will win and their bet will be doubled. However, if they guess incorrectly, they lose their bet. 

The game continues until either the player loses all their money or they reach 21. If the player reaches 21, they automatically win and their bet is paid out at 2:1 odds.

#  What is Hi-Lo Switch Johannes?

Hi-Lo Switch Johannes is a card game that can be played with two to four players. The aim of the game is to discard all of your cards. The first player to discard all their cards, wins the game.



The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. Aces are worth one point, two through 10 are worth face value, and a king, queen or jack are each worth 10 points. The Hi-Lo switch card is wild and can represent any other card in the deck.



To begin the game, each player is dealt seven cards. The remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the players as the stock pile. The top card of the stock pile is turned over to begin the turn and this becomes the current card. Play passes clockwise around the table with each player taking one turn per round. On a player's turn they must do one of three things: draw from the stock pile, play a card from their hand or Hi-Lo switch (discard). If a player cannot play due to being unable to match either the rank or suit of the current card, they must draw one card from the stock pile. When drawing cards from either the stock pile or another player's hand, always draw from the leftmost position in the stack/hand.



The current card dictates which suits are active for that particular turn. If the current card is an ace, spades are active; if it's two then clubs are active and so on. If a Hi-Lo switch card is played, then whichever suit is currently active will become inactive and vice versa. When playing a numbered card, that number's suit becomes active (e.g., if an eight of hearts is played, then all hearts become active). A player can only play a number card if they have no other option available to them (e.g., they cannot play an Ace of Spades if they still have spades in their hand). When playing a wild Hi-Lo switch card, whatever suit is currently active will become inactive and vice versa (e.g., playing an Ace of Spades as your wildcard will stop clubs from being active).



The winner of Hi-Lo switch Johannes is the first player to discard all their cards.
