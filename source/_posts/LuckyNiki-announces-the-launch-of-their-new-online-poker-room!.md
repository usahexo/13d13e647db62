#  How are online poker hands ranked? LuckyNiki explains!

In poker, the rank of a hand is determined by its combination of cards. The higher the rank, the better the hand. In most poker variants, the ranking of hands starts with the highest card and goes down to the lowest. Here is a list of all possible poker hands, in descending order:

## Royal flush
A royal flush is an ace-high straight flush. It is the highest ranked hand in poker and consists of 5 cards of the same suit: A♠ K♠ Q♠ J♠ 10♠. There are only 4 possible royal flushes in a deck of 52 cards, making it one of the rarest hands in poker.

## Straight flush
A straight flush is a hand that contains 5 consecutive cards all of the same suit. For example, 8♥ 9♥ 10♥ J♥ K♥ is a straight flush. Straights flushes can be composed of either 2 different suits or all spades (for example A♦ 2♦ 3♦ 4♦ 5♦). The rank of a straight flush is always determined by the rank of its highest card. In the example above, K♥ would be the highest card and would therefore make this hand rank higher than an 8♥ 10♦ J♣ Q♥ (an 8-high straight). There are 4 possible straight flushes in a deck of 52 cards, making it one of the less rare hands in poker.

## Four of a kind
A four of a kind is composed of 4 cards with the same rank (e.g. 4 kings). There are 13 different four-of-a-kind combinations in a deck of 52 cards. This makes it one of the more common hands in poker.

## Full house
A full house consists of 3 cards with one rank and 2 cards with another rank (e.g. 3 kings and 2 queens). This hand ranks above two pairs but below a four-of-a-kind. There are 6 possible full houses in a deck or 52 cards (3x2x1=6).

## Three Of A Kind 
Three Of A Kind(3 OFAK) ia composed three matching ranked card.(e..g 3 Jacks)There are 10 possibles three-of-a-kinds when using 13 available ranking spots on two holecards and five communitycards(10/13=3/4).This makes it one more common hand then Full House.(6/52=3/13)
