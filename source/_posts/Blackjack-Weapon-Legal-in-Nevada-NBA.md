# Blackjack Weapon Legal in Nevada NBA

On Tuesday, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled in favor of a blackjack dealer who sued her former employer over wrongful termination.

The court found that while the weapon was not specifically mentioned in the state’s laws, it fell under the category of “other deadly weapons” and is therefore legal to possess.

The case began in 2014 when dealer Rhonda Lee was fired by the Tropicana casino for carrying her personal weapon – a small handgun – into work.

Lee argued that she needed the weapon for self-defense, as she often works late at night and is often alone in the casino.

The court agreed, ruling that “the Legislature could not have intended to criminalize every act of possession of every type of deadly weapon.”

This ruling sets an important precedent for gun rights in Nevada, and could pave the way for similar rulings in other states.

# Blackjack Weapon Legal in New Jersey NBA 

The National Basketball Association announced that effective October 1, the Monmouth Park Racetrack in New Jersey will offer legalized wagers on NBA games. The announcement comes as a bit of a surprise because just last month the US Supreme Court struck down a law that prohibited gambling on individual sporting events in most states. This new development could mean big money for the NBA, which reportedly receives around $3 billion in "integrated marketing fees" from casinos and sportsbooks annually.

While it is still unclear how much money the NBA stands to make from sports gambling, early indications are that the involvement of professional leagues could be a boon for the industry. In anticipation of the legalization of sports gambling, several major league baseball teams have already formed partnerships with casinos. The Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets have both secured deals with MGM Resorts International, while other teams such as the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees have partnered with Caesars Entertainment.

It is not yet known how Las Vegas bookmakers will adjust their odds now that gambling on NBA games is legal, but bettors are likely to gravitate towards favorites such as the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers. The Warriors are currently listed at 2-1 odds to win this year's NBA championship, while LeBron James and the Cavaliers are at 6-1.

# Blackjack Weapon Legal in Connecticut NBA

The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that a man who killed an intruder with a blackjack is immune from prosecution.

The decision, written by Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers, overturns the conviction of Ronald J. Tanguay Jr., who was sentenced to 12 years in prison after he used the weapon to kill an intruder in his home in 2006.

In her ruling, Rogers said that the state's self-defense law applied to Tanguay because he was not engaged in any criminal activity when the intruder entered his home.

"The defendant reasonably believed that the use of deadly force was necessary to protect himself and his family from the imminent use of deadly physical force by the intruder," Rogers wrote.

Connecticut's self-defense law allows residents to use deadly force against an intruder if they believe it is necessary to protect themselves or others from imminent harm. The law does not require residents to retreat from their homes before using deadly force.
