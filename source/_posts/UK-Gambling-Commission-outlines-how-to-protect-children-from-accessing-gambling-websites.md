#  UK Gambling Commission outlines how to protect children from accessing gambling websites

The UK Gambling Commission has outlined how to protect children from accessing gambling websites.

The Commission has advised parents to use filtering software, set betting limits, and talk to their children about the risks of gambling.

They also urged betting firms to do more to protect children, including age verification checks and preventing them from accessing gambling websites from school computers.

Research by the Commission has shown that one in six children aged 11-16 have gambled in the past week, with boys being more likely than girls to gamble.

Gambling can have serious consequences for children, including developing problems with money and becoming addicted.

Parents can find out more about how to protect their children from gambling by visiting the website of the UK Gambling Commission.

#  Study finds that parents are still largely unaware of how to prevent their children from gambling online

Despite government warnings and high-profile cases of addiction, a new study has found that many parents are still largely unaware of how to prevent their children from gambling online.

The report, released by the UK Gambling Commission, surveyed more than 2000 parents with children aged between 11 and 16. It found that while 82% of parents were aware of the risks associated with online gambling, only 44% had taken any steps to prevent their children from engaging in it.

And while 81% of parents said they would be worried if their child became addicted to gambling, a worrying number said they would not know what to do if that did happen.

The report’s lead author, Dr Mark Griffiths, said the findings should act as a wake-up call for parents.

“The results suggest that there is a lot of work still to be done in terms of both education and prevention when it comes to stopping children from gambling online,” he said.

Griffiths said one of the key problems was that many parents wrongly saw online gambling as a low-risk activity.

“Gambling activities can be very easily accessed on smartphones and other devices, and this seems to be leading some parents into a false sense of security about the risks involved,” he said.

The commission has urged parents to take steps such as installing parental controls on devices and discussing the risks of online gambling with their children.

#  How to keep your children safe when they gamble online

Gambling is a popular leisure activity enjoyed by people of all ages all over the world. For many, gambling is a fun way to pass the time and maybe win some money while they’re at it. But for parents, the worry that their children may be gambling online can be a cause for concern.

Thankfully, there are some precautions you can take to help keep your children safe when they gamble online. Here are four tips to get you started:

1. Talk to your children about gambling

The first step in helping to keep your children safe when they gamble online is to talk to them about it. It’s important that they understand the risks involved in gambling and what could happen if they lose control. Help them develop sensible attitudes towards gambling so that they are less likely to take unnecessary risks when they gamble online.

2. Set rules and boundaries

As with any other activity, it’s important to set rules and boundaries for your children when it comes to gambling. This means establishing what kind of gambling is allowed and what is not, as well as specifying how much money they are allowed to spend on it. Establishing these guidelines will help your children stay safe when they gamble online.

3. Keep an eye on their spending habits

It’s also important to keep an eye on your children’s spending habits, especially when it comes to gambling. If you see any evidence that they are starting to spend too much money on gambling, then it’s time to step in and put a stop to it. This will help protect them from going into debt or becoming addicted to gambling.

4. Monitor their computer use

Finally, you should monitor your children’s computer use closely, especially when they are gambling online. This will help you keep track of which websites they are visiting and ensure that they aren’t accessing any inappropriate content or engaging in risky behaviour.
