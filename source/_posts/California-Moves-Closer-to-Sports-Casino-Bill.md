#  California Moves Closer to Sports Casino Bill

As the gaming industry continues to grow, many states are looking for ways to get a slice of the pie. California is one of those states, and it’s moving closer to passing a bill that would legalize sports betting.

The bill, which was introduced by Assemblyman Adam Gray back in February, is currently being reviewed by the state’s gambling regulators. If it gets their approval, it will then move on to the state legislature for a vote.

Gray has been an advocate for legalized sports betting in California for years and is confident that the current bill will pass.

“This is not a new issue for me, I’ve been advocating for this since 2011,” he said. “I believe this is something that should be regulated and taxed because it is happening anyway. We might as well bring some of that money into our economy.”

If the bill does pass, it will be up to the individual cities and counties to decide whether or not to allow sports betting within their borders. And while casinos are likely to be the most popular destination for bettors, some officials are also pushing for mobile betting options as well.

While there is still some opposition to legalized sports betting in California, most believe that it’s only a matter of time before the bill passes. With other states already taking in millions of dollars from sports wagers each year, it’s hard to see why California wouldn’t want to get in on the action.

#  Pennsylvania Senate Passes Sports Casino Bill

The Pennsylvania Senate approved a bill on Wednesday that would allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state.

The measure now heads to the House, where it is uncertain if lawmakers will pass it. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has said he would sign the bill into law if it reaches his desk.

The bill, which was sponsored by Republican Sen. Roger Erickson, would let casinos and racetracks partner with professional sports leagues and teams to offer sports betting. The leagues would have a one percent “integrity fee” on all bets, which would be used to pay for oversight of the games.

Casinos and racetracks could also operate their own sportsbooks, or contract with an outside company to do so. Online sports gambling would be permitted, but only through casinos and racetracks.

Pennsylvania is the fourth state to legalize sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in May 2018. Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia already offer sports betting, and more than a dozen other states are considering it.

#  New York Assembly Leaders Introduce Sports Casino Bill

New York Assembly leaders announced a new sports casino bill this week that would authorize the construction of new sports stadiums and allow bookmakers to operate on site. The proposed legislation comes as a response to the state’s failed bid to host the 2026 World Cup, which was recently awarded to Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

Governor Andrew Cuomo has voiced his support for the measure, stating that it will create jobs and stimulate the economy. However, critics argue that the bill will have negative consequences for taxpayers, who will be forced to fund the construction of new stadiums.

Under the proposed legislation, sports teams would be able to lease land from the state for up to 99 years at a cost of $1 per year. In addition, bookmakers would be allowed to operate on site, which is seen as a key component of the bill’s success. Supporters believe that allowing bookmakers to operate on site will help reduce illegal gambling operations and generate tax revenue.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased taxes and stadium costs for taxpayers. They also argue that it will benefit wealthy team owners at the expense of everyday New Yorkers.

It is still unclear whether or not the bill will pass in the legislature. If it does pass, it is likely that there will be a veto fight with Governor Cuomo.

#  Illinois House Committee Advances Sports Betting Bill

On Wednesday, the Illinois House Committee on Gaming and Wagering advanced a sports betting bill.

The bill would legalize sports betting in Illinois, including at casinos and horse racing tracks. It would also allow for mobile and online sports betting.

Governor J.B. Pritzker has voiced support for the bill. In a press release, he said, "I am proud to support this legislation that will legalize and regulate sports betting in Illinois. This new industry will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for our state."

Sponsors of the bill say that it could generate up to $200 million in annual revenue for the state.
