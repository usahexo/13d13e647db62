#  Regional gambling ban lifted, casinos open in SimCity!

After a long wait and much anticipation, the regional gambling ban has been lifted and casinos have finally opened in SimCity! The change came as a surprise to many, as the debate over the issue had seemingly died down in recent months.

However, with the ban now lifted, a flurry of new development is taking place in the city's casino district. According to local officials, the aim is to create a world-class gambling destination that will rival the likes of Monte Carlo and Las Vegas.

To that end, several new casino resorts are under construction, along with several luxury hotels and high-end retail outlets. In addition, a new monorail system is being built to connect the district with the rest of the city.

Critics of the move argue that it will lead to an increase in crime and social ills. However, proponents argue that it will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the city. They also point out that measures are being taken to mitigate any potential problems, such as increased security and restrictions on who can enter the casinos.

So far there has been little opposition to the opening of casinos in SimCity, but only time will tell if they prove to be a blessing or a curse for this growing metropolis.

#  Mayor Bloomberg offers big casino bonus to help revive flagging economy

In an effort to breathe new life into the city's flagging economy, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has announced a proposal to offer a casino license and $5 billion in gambling revenue to any company that agrees to build a new casino in the city. The move is seen as a way to bring in much-needed jobs and revenue to the city, which is suffering from high unemployment and a budget deficit.

The proposal has generated a great deal of interest among casino developers, who are eager to get their hands on the lucrative license. However, it has also sparked criticism from some who argue that casinos are bad for society and that the money could be better spent on other things.

Despite the objections, Bloomberg is confident that the proposal will be approved. "A new casino will create thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in economic activity," he said. "It's an important part of our plan to revive the economy and help New Yorkers get back to work."
