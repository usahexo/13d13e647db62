        <h1 id="California-Moves-Closer-to-Sports-Casino-Bill"><a href="#California-Moves-Closer-to-Sports-Casino-Bill" class="headerlink" title="California Moves Closer to Sports Casino Bill"></a>California Moves Closer to Sports Casino Bill</h1><p>As the gaming industry continues to grow, many states are looking for ways to get a slice of the pie. California is one of those states, and it’s moving closer to passing a bill that would legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>The bill, which was introduced by Assemblyman Adam Gray back in February, is currently being reviewed by the state’s gambling regulators. If it gets their approval, it will then move on to the state legislature for a vote.</p>
<p>Gray has been an advocate for legalized sports betting in California for years and is confident that the current bill will pass.</p>
<p>“This is not a new issue for me, I’ve been advocating for this since 2011,” he said. “I believe this is something that should be regulated and taxed because it is happening anyway. We might as well bring some of that money into our economy.”</p>
<p>If the bill does pass, it will be up to the individual cities and counties to decide whether or not to allow sports betting within their borders. And while casinos are likely to be the most popular destination for bettors, some officials are also pushing for mobile betting options as well.</p>
<p>While there is still some opposition to legalized sports betting in California, most believe that it’s only a matter of time before the bill passes. With other states already taking in millions of dollars from sports wagers each year, it’s hard to see why California wouldn’t want to get in on the action.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Senate-Passes-Sports-Casino-Bill"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Senate-Passes-Sports-Casino-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Senate Passes Sports Casino Bill"></a>Pennsylvania Senate Passes Sports Casino Bill</h1><p>The Pennsylvania Senate approved a bill on Wednesday that would allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state.</p>
<p>The measure now heads to the House, where it is uncertain if lawmakers will pass it. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has said he would sign the bill into law if it reaches his desk.</p>
<p>The bill, which was sponsored by Republican Sen. Roger Erickson, would let casinos and racetracks partner with professional sports leagues and teams to offer sports betting. The leagues would have a one percent “integrity fee” on all bets, which would be used to pay for oversight of the games.</p>
<p>Casinos and racetracks could also operate their own sportsbooks, or contract with an outside company to do so. Online sports gambling would be permitted, but only through casinos and racetracks.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is the fourth state to legalize sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in May 2018. Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia already offer sports betting, and more than a dozen other states are considering it.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Assembly-Leaders-Introduce-Sports-Casino-Bill"><a href="#New-York-Assembly-Leaders-Introduce-Sports-Casino-Bill" class="headerlink" title="New York Assembly Leaders Introduce Sports Casino Bill"></a>New York Assembly Leaders Introduce Sports Casino Bill</h1><p>New York Assembly leaders announced a new sports casino bill this week that would authorize the construction of new sports stadiums and allow bookmakers to operate on site. The proposed legislation comes as a response to the state’s failed bid to host the 2026 World Cup, which was recently awarded to Canada, Mexico, and the United States.</p>
<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo has voiced his support for the measure, stating that it will create jobs and stimulate the economy. However, critics argue that the bill will have negative consequences for taxpayers, who will be forced to fund the construction of new stadiums.</p>
<p>Under the proposed legislation, sports teams would be able to lease land from the state for up to 99 years at a cost of $1 per year. In addition, bookmakers would be allowed to operate on site, which is seen as a key component of the bill’s success. Supporters believe that allowing bookmakers to operate on site will help reduce illegal gambling operations and generate tax revenue.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased taxes and stadium costs for taxpayers. They also argue that it will benefit wealthy team owners at the expense of everyday New Yorkers.</p>
<p>It is still unclear whether or not the bill will pass in the legislature. If it does pass, it is likely that there will be a veto fight with Governor Cuomo.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-House-Committee-Advances-Sports-Betting-Bill"><a href="#Illinois-House-Committee-Advances-Sports-Betting-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Illinois House Committee Advances Sports Betting Bill"></a>Illinois House Committee Advances Sports Betting Bill</h1><p>On Wednesday, the Illinois House Committee on Gaming and Wagering advanced a sports betting bill.</p>
<p>The bill would legalize sports betting in Illinois, including at casinos and horse racing tracks. It would also allow for mobile and online sports betting.</p>
<p>Governor J.B. Pritzker has voiced support for the bill. In a press release, he said, “I am proud to support this legislation that will legalize and regulate sports betting in Illinois. This new industry will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for our state.”</p>
<p>Sponsors of the bill say that it could generate up to $200 million in annual revenue for the state.<br> to read more please visit:</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Senate-Approves-Sports-Betting-Bill"><a href="#Maryland-Senate-Approves-Sports-Betting-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Senate Approves Sports Betting Bill"></a>Maryland Senate Approves Sports Betting Bill</h1><p>The Maryland Senate has approved a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>The measure, which was introduced by Senator Bill Ferguson, would allow licensed casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting. The bill would also allow the state’s lottery to offer online sports betting.</p>
<p>The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 29-8. It now goes to the House of Delegates for consideration.</p>
<p>Governor Larry Hogan has said he would sign a bill legalizing sports betting if it reaches his desk.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased rates of addiction and gambling losses. Supporters say that it would create jobs and generate revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Under the proposed legislation, casinos and racetracks would be allowed to offer both in-person and online sports betting. Bettors would be able to bet on professional and college sports, as well as international sporting events.</p>
<p>The proposal allows the state’s lottery to offer online sports betting through its existing website, MOLottery.com. The lottery would be able to offer wagers on both pre-game and in-game bets.</p>
<p>Lottery officials say they expect that they would generate $24 million in annual revenue from sports betting. This money would be used to fund education programs in the state.</p>
<p>Casinos and racetracks could also generate significant revenue from sports betting. Officials estimate that these businesses could bring in over $100 million per year in revenue from sports betting operations.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it will create jobs in the state’s casino and racing industries. They argue that it will also help boost tourism at these businesses.</p>
<p>Maryland lawmakers are considering a measure that would legalize sports betting in the state. TheSenate has approved the bill, which now goes to theHouseof Delegates for consideration</p>
