<p>The Commission has advised parents to use filtering software, set betting limits, and talk to their children about the risks of gambling.</p>
<p>They also urged betting firms to do more to protect children, including age verification checks and preventing them from accessing gambling websites from school computers.</p>
<p>Research by the Commission has shown that one in six children aged 11-16 have gambled in the past week, with boys being more likely than girls to gamble.</p>
<p>Gambling can have serious consequences for children, including developing problems with money and becoming addicted.</p>
<p>Parents can find out more about how to protect their children from gambling by visiting the website of the UK Gambling Commission.</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-that-parents-are-still-largely-unaware-of-how-to-prevent-their-children-from-gambling-online"><a href="#Study-finds-that-parents-are-still-largely-unaware-of-how-to-prevent-their-children-from-gambling-online" class="headerlink" title="Study finds that parents are still largely unaware of how to prevent their children from gambling online"></a>Study finds that parents are still largely unaware of how to prevent their children from gambling online</h1><p>Despite government warnings and high-profile cases of addiction, a new study has found that many parents are still largely unaware of how to prevent their children from gambling online.</p>
<p>The report, released by the UK Gambling Commission, surveyed more than 2000 parents with children aged between 11 and 16. It found that while 82% of parents were aware of the risks associated with online gambling, only 44% had taken any steps to prevent their children from engaging in it.</p>
<p>And while 81% of parents said they would be worried if their child became addicted to gambling, a worrying number said they would not know what to do if that did happen.</p>
<p>The report’s lead author, Dr Mark Griffiths, said the findings should act as a wake-up call for parents.</p>
<p>“The results suggest that there is a lot of work still to be done in terms of both education and prevention when it comes to stopping children from gambling online,” he said.</p>
<p>Griffiths said one of the key problems was that many parents wrongly saw online gambling as a low-risk activity.</p>
<p>“Gambling activities can be very easily accessed on smartphones and other devices, and this seems to be leading some parents into a false sense of security about the risks involved,” he said.</p>
<p>The commission has urged parents to take steps such as installing parental controls on devices and discussing the risks of online gambling with their children.</p>
<h1 id="Five-easy-ways-to-prevent-your-children-from-gambling-online"><a href="#Five-easy-ways-to-prevent-your-children-from-gambling-online" class="headerlink" title="Five easy ways to prevent your children from gambling online"></a>Five easy ways to prevent your children from gambling online</h1><p>Gambling is a serious problem that can have a negative impact on the lives of children and adolescents. According to recent studies, an estimated 1.7 million American youth aged 12 to 17 years are problem gamblers. Here are five easy ways to help prevent your children from gambling online:</p>
<ol>
<li>talk openly and honestly with your children about the risks associated with gambling</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to talk to your children about the risks associated with gambling, including the dangers of losing money, developing addiction problems, and being scammed. Talk to them about why it might be fun to gamble responsibly and how they can do this.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>set rules and limits on how much money your children can spend on gambling</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to set rules and limits on how much money your children can spend on gambling. This will help them control their spending and minimize the risks associated with gambling.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>keep track of where your children are spending their time online</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to keep track of where your children are spending their time online, especially when it comes to gambling websites. If you see that they are visiting gambling websites, talk to them about why this might be a bad idea and explain the risks involved.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>install filtering software on all of your family’s devices</li>
</ol>
<p>You can install filtering software on all of your family’s devices to help prevent them from accessing gambling websites. This software will help block websites that promote or allow online gambling.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>get involved in your children’s online lives</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to get involved in your children’s online lives, especially when it comes to gambling websites. By staying informed about which websites they are visiting, you can help them stay safe while online.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-keep-your-children-safe-when-they-gamble-online"><a href="#How-to-keep-your-children-safe-when-they-gamble-online" class="headerlink" title="How to keep your children safe when they gamble online"></a>How to keep your children safe when they gamble online</h1><p>Gambling is a popular leisure activity enjoyed by people of all ages all over the world. For many, gambling is a fun way to pass the time and maybe win some money while they’re at it. But for parents, the worry that their children may be gambling online can be a cause for concern.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are some precautions you can take to help keep your children safe when they gamble online. Here are four tips to get you started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk to your children about gambling</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step in helping to keep your children safe when they gamble online is to talk to them about it. It’s important that they understand the risks involved in gambling and what could happen if they lose control. Help them develop sensible attitudes towards gambling so that they are less likely to take unnecessary risks when they gamble online.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Set rules and boundaries</li>
</ol>
<p>As with any other activity, it’s important to set rules and boundaries for your children when it comes to gambling. This means establishing what kind of gambling is allowed and what is not, as well as specifying how much money they are allowed to spend on it. Establishing these guidelines will help your children stay safe when they gamble online.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Keep an eye on their spending habits</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s also important to keep an eye on your children’s spending habits, especially when it comes to gambling. If you see any evidence that they are starting to spend too much money on gambling, then it’s time to step in and put a stop to it. This will help protect them from going into debt or becoming addicted to gambling.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Monitor their computer use</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, you should monitor your children’s computer use closely, especially when they are gambling online. This will help you keep track of which websites they are visiting and ensure that they aren’t accessing any inappropriate content or engaging in risky behaviour.</p>

<p>The guidance offers a number of recommendations for online gambling operators, including the need to:</p>
<p>-Ensure age verification measures are in place<br>-Restrict the amount of money that can be spent on gambling in a single transaction<br>-Make sure terms and conditions are easy to understand<br>-Inform customers about responsible gambling policies</p>
<p>The guidance also warns parents and carers about the dangers of children accessing internet gambling, and provides advice on how to keep them safe.</p>
<p>Gambling Commission Chief Executive Neil Collins said: “We want children to be safe when they are using the internet, and we want parents and carers to be aware of the risks so they can take steps to protect their children. Our new guidance will help operators ensure that their websites are child-friendly, and provide information to parents and carers about how they can keep their children safe.”</p>
